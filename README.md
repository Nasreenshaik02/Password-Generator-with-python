# Password-Generator-with-python
A password generator is a tool that creates random and complex passwords, typically consisting of a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. These generated passwords are designed to be strong and difficult for others to guess or crack, enhancing the security of online accounts. 
CHAPTER 1

ABSTRACT

Security is one of the most crucial parts of our lives. The importance of security is increasing day by day as most things are going online. Passwords come into light as we talk about security. In this project, we will create a password generator that helps us generate random and strong passwords quickly.

The best thing about creating our own password generator is that we can customize it as we like.

First, we will create a password generator that asks the length of the password and generates a random password containing digits, alphabets, and special characters. Next, we will improve it by asking the number of each type of character, like the number of digits, alphabets, and special characters. We try to guarantee that the program will include digits and special characters by asking the user to enter the number of digits, alphabets, and special characters they want. When the user enters the number of characters for each type, the program will include the respective number of character types into the password.
